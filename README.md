# Christoffer Madsen 👋  
**Indie tool builder · UX-focused developer · Local-first enthusiast**

I build software because I want it to exist.

Mostly tools, apps, and systems that value clarity, user control, and long-term usefulness over trends. I’m skeptical of SaaS-by-default, allergic to unnecessary accounts, and deeply interested in software that works offline, locally, and on the user’s terms.

By day I work in IT support at Elkjøp Halden.  
By night I build things I wish already existed.

## Active projects

### 🧾 Fattern (active)
A completely free, local-first accounting-lite app.

- No accounts
- No cloud
- No SaaS
- Full data ownership

Send and manage invoices, track expenses, and keep control of your own data. Built for people who don’t want their finances trapped behind a login screen.

---

### 🗂️ Geyma (active)
A modern file manager for Linux.

Focused on:
- clean, intentional UX
- speed and clarity over feature bloat
- small, tasteful AI assistance where it actually helps

Not trying to reinvent files. Just trying to make them less annoying.

---

### 🧠 Aplio (early)
A job application tool with *responsible* AI use.

- No auto-rejections
- No fake “AI decided” excuses
- Strong emphasis on human accountability and transparency

Built around the idea that applicants deserve to be treated like people, not spam.

---

### 🖥️ Localhost Hub (active-ish)
A developer tool aimed at reducing terminal dependency.

Provides a sleek, organized UI for common workflows that normally live in shell commands. Designed to lower friction without hiding what’s actually happening.

---

### ⚰️ Dead Repo (active-ish)
A deliberately silly app that judges your repositories.

Repos are treated as dead or dying projects, complete with:
- autopsy reports
- personality-driven commentary
- varying degrees of brutality

Built mostly for fun. Surprisingly good at making people reflect on abandoned code.

---

### 🎮 Forge2D (active-ish)
A 2D game engine written in Rust.

- Engine core in place
- Editor in progress
- Long-term exploration project

Less about shipping a Unity killer, more about learning engine architecture the hard way.

---

## How I like to build

- Tool-first, product-minded
- Strong UX bias
- Local-first and offline-capable by default
- Minimal magic, explicit behavior
- Software should respect the user’s time and data

I enjoy owning the whole thing: data model → logic → UI → packaging.

## Tech I use

**Frontend**
- React, Vite, Next.js
- Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express
- MySQL / MariaDB
- REST APIs, auth, background tasks

**Desktop & tooling**
- Electron, Tauri (case by case)
- Local storage, IndexedDB
- Cross-platform packaging

**Infra**
- Linux
- Apache
- DigitalOcean
- Git & GitHub Actions

---

## GitHub

GitHub is a mix of:
- portfolio
- product distribution
- open-source experiments

Some projects are public, some are private, and not everything I build lives here.
